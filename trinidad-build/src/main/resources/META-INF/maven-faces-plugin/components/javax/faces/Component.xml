<ul>
<li>They must start with a letter (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method) or underscore ( _ ).</li>
<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers 
be as short as possible. If a component has been given an identifier, it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that component 
that is a NamingContainer (if any).</li>

      <description>whether the component is rendered. When set to false, no output will be
		delivered for this component (the component will not in any way be rendered,
		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.
